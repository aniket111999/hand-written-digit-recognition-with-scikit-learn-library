# hand-written-digit-recognition-with-scikit-learn-library

we have used scikit library for Handwritten digit recognition .
scikit library has digits datset having 1797 8*8 pixel images 
ranges from 0-9.
we have used 1790 images for train (fit) model with there target 
values from 0 to 9 .
we have used 1791 to 1797 images for prediction by our trained model.
then we have validated output prediction with target values of respective images.
